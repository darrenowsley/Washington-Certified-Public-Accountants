## Motivation Statement

The motivation behind analyzing this dataset is to gain insights into CPA licensing patterns, track active and lapsed licenses, and understand the geographical distribution of licensed professionals. By examining trends in licensing dates and statuses, stakeholders can identify regulatory compliance patterns, renewal frequencies, and potential areas of professional shortages or surpluses.

This dataset can serve as a valuable resource for regulatory boards, professional associations, and researchers interested in workforce analytics, credential verification, and the broader impact of licensing regulations on the accounting profession. Understanding these patterns can help improve policy decisions, streamline licensing processes, and ensure better oversight of CPA professionals.
